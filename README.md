# media_souce_trends

For this project, we used google trends data to investigate which was searched more: Fox News or CNN?  We then hosted our findings on a webpage.  To view, clone this repository and open the index.html file with your default browser.

### Goals:
- Visualize search trends of Fox News vs. CNN News (by state, year, and month)
- Compare search trends to real election data (2008, 2012, 2016)
- Analyze preferred method of voting (early, in-person, by mail)

### Visualizations of Search Trends:

### Analysis:
- Voting by mail and absentee has been continually increasing
- Against common belief voting by mail does not correlate to the party that gets elected
- Search trends seem to favor the political party of the president in office at the time (When Obama is in office, CNN is more popular.  When Trump is in office, Fox is more popular)
- Whenever the interest for one media rises, the other one spikes up as well. 
- Huge gaps between the interests for CNN and FOX (about 20%-50% difference), but the gap got closed gradually
- Spikes in the line chart coincide with important political events such as 2008,2012, and 2016 elections
- As of May 2018, more people were searching for FOX than CNN
